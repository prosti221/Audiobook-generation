Experimenting with AI generated audiobooks using GPT4 and ElevenLabs TTS.

This requires both an openAI and elevenlabs API key.
You also need to create voices with labels used in the code such that they can be matched with the characters.

The labels used for now are: {'sex' male/female, 'age':young/old, 'accent':british/american/irish/scottish/indian}, change these as you like.

I am experimenting using tortoise TTS as a free alternative to elevenlabs that can be run locally, however inference is REALLY slow in comparison.
